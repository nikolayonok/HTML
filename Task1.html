<h1>Vehicle</h1>

A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<sup> <font color="navy">[1]</font></sup> ) is a machine that transports people or cargo.
Vehicles include wagons,<br/> bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses),
railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships,<br/> boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft),
aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and<br/> spacecraft.<sup><font color="navy">[2]</font> </sup>
<br/>
<br/>

Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground:<br/> wheeled,
tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation,
for<br/> road vehicles types, terms and definitions.<sup><font color="navy">[3]</font></sup>
